        <p>Dear reader,</p>
        <p>
          My name is Lota. I was born in a small town in Nigeria. My dad - an Artist. My mom - an English Teacher.
          Growing up in a fundamentally artsy home meant a number of things.
        </p>
        <p>I knew how to make things with my hands and I asked too many questions.</p>
        <p>
          I always wondered how phones were made. Who put all these text, colours and pages in a digital box and made it
          work ? Whoever they were I wanted to be like them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It turns out, I'm now a senior product designer who has spent the last 4 years designing from the ground up
          proptech, insurtech, fintech and social experiences across frontier marketplaces.
        </p>
        <p>In big and small ways, working in tech is changing my life and millions of other people.</p>
        <p>
          Also, did you know I recently started exploring all the things that I used to do but don't? All the things I
          wished I could do but didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chasing hobbies is what I call it. 5 months ago it was tennis. Before that, I started running. Last month I
          started relearning how to draw. Today i'm running Behind the Ship, a 60-minute talk show between me (the host)
          and African Creators where they share stories on their journeys – uncovering insights around how they crafted
          and shipped something big, something small, something great. Independently or within teams.
        </p>
        <p>If you're still reading, take this as a sign. Any sign:)</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Cheers</p>
